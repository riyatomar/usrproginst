Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0001	Do you remember the nursery rhyme ?
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0002	Twinkle, twinkle little star!
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0003	Starry nights have always attracted us since the childhood.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0004	You may also have thought of these stars and had numerous questions in your mind.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0005	Questions such as how many stars are there in the sky?
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0006	How did they come into existence?
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0007	Can one reach the end of the sky?
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0008	May be many more such questions are still there in your mind.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0009	In this chapter, you will learn how these “twinkling little stars” were formed.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0010	With that you will eventually also read the story of origin and evolution of the earth.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0011	A large number of hypotheses were put forth by different philosophers and scientists regarding the origin of the earth.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0012	 One of the earlier and popular arguments was by German philosopher Immanuel Kant.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0013	Mathematician Laplace revised it in 1796. It is known as Nebular Hypothesis
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0014	The hypothesis considered that the planets were formed out of a cloud of material associated with a youthful sun.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0015	Later in 1900, Chamberlain and Moulton considered that a wandering star approached the sun which was slowly rotating.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0016	As a result, a cigar-shaped extension of material was separated from the solar surface.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0017	As the passing star moved away, the material separated from the solar surface continued to revolve around the sun and it slowly condensed into planets
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0018	Sir James Jeans and later Sir Harold Jeffrey supported this argument.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0019	At a later date, the arguments considered of a companion to the sun to have been coexisting. 
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0020	These arguments are called binary theories.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0021	 In 1950, Otto Schmidt in Russia and Carl Weizascar in Germany somewhat revised the ‘nebular hypothesis’, though differing in details.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0022	They considered that the sun was surrounded by solar nebula containing mostly the hydrogen and helium along with what may be termed as dust.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0023	The friction and collision of particles led to formation of a disk-shaped cloud and the planets were formed through the process of accretion.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0024	However, scientists in later period took up the problems of origin of universe rather than that of just the earth or the planets.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0025	The most popular argument regarding the origin of the universe is the Big Bang Theory.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0026	It is also called expanding universe hypothesis. 
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0027	 Edwin Hubble, in 1920, provided evidence that the universe is expanding.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0028	As time passes, galaxies move further and further apart.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0029	You can experiment and find what does the expanding universe mean.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0030	Take a balloon and mark some points on it to represent the galaxies.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0031	 Now, if you start inflating the balloon, the points marked on the balloon will appear to be moving away from each other as the balloon expands.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0032	Similarly, the distance between the galaxies is also found to be increasing and thereby, the universe is considered to be expanding.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0033	However, you will find that besides the increase in the distances between the points on the balloon, the points themselves are expanding.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0034	This is not in accordance with the fact.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0035	Scientists believe that though the space between the galaxies is increasing, observations do not support the expansion of galaxies.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0036	So, the balloon example is only partially correct
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0037	In the beginning, all matter forming the universe existed in one place in the form of a “tiny ball” (singular atom) with an unimaginably small volume
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0038	At the Big Bang the “tiny ball” exploded violently.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0039	It is now generally accepted that the event of big bang took place 13.7 billion years before the present
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0040	The expansion continues even to the present day.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0041	As it grew, some energy was converted into matter. 
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0042	There was particularly rapid expansion within fractions of a second after the bang
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0043	Thereafter, the expansion has slowed down.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0044	Within first three minutes from the Big Bang event, the first atom began to form
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0045	Within 300,000 years from the Big Bang, temperature dropped to 4,500K (Kelvin) and gave rise to atomic matter
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0046	The universe became transparent.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0047	The expansion of universe means increase in space between the galaxies
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0048	An alternative to this was Hoyle’s concept of steady state.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0049	It considered the universe to be roughly the same at any point of time
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0050	However, with greater evidence becoming available about the expanding universe, scientific community at present favours argument of expanding universe
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0051	The distribution of matter and energy was not even in the early universe.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0052	These initial density differences gave rise to differences in gravitational forces and it caused the matterto get drawn together.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0053	These formed the bases for development of galaxies.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0054	A galaxy contains a large number of stars.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0055	Galaxies spread over vast distances that are measured in thousands of light-years.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0056	The diameters of individual galaxies range from 80,000-150,000 light years. 
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0057	A galaxy starts to form by accumulation of hydrogen gas in the form of a very large cloud called nebula. 
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0058	Eventually, growing nebula develops localised clumps of gas.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0059	These clumps continue to grow into even denser gaseous bodies, giving rise to formation of stars. 
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0060	The formation of stars is believed to have taken place some 5-6 billion years ago.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0061	The stars are localised lumps of gas within a nebula.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0062	The gravitational force within the lumps leads to the formation of a core to the gas cloud and a huge rotating disc of gas and dust develops around the gas core.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0063	In the next stage, the gas cloud starts getting condensed and the matter around the core develops into smallrounded objects.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0064	These small-rounded objects by the process of cohesion develop into what is called planetesimals.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0065	Larger bodies start forming by collision,and gravitational attraction causes the material to stick together. 
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0066	Planetesimals are a large number of smaller bodies. 
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0067	Our Solar system consists of eight planets.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0068	The nebula from which our Solar system is supposed to have been formed, started its collapse and core formation some time 5-5.6 billion years ago and the planets were formed about 4.6 billion years ago.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0069	Our solar system consists of the sun (the star), 8 planets, 63 moons, millions of smaller bodies like asteroids and comets and huge quantity of dust-grains and gases.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0070	Out of the eight planets, mercury, venus,earth and mars are called as the inner planets as they lie between the sun and the belt of asteroids. 
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0071	the other four planets are called the outer planets.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0072	Alternatively, the first four are called Terrestrial.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0073	meaning earth-like as they are made up of rock and metals, and have relatively high densities.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0074	The rest four are called Jovian or Gas Giant planets.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0075	Jovian means jupiter-like.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0076	Most of them are much larger than the terrestrial planets and have thick atmosphere, mostly of helium and hydrogen.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0077	All the planets were formed in the same period sometime about 4.6 billion years ago.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0078	Till recently,Pluto was also considered a planet.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0079	The terrestrial planets were formed in the close vicinity of the parent star where it was too warm for gases to condense to solid particles.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0080	Jovian planets were formed at quite a distant location.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0081	The solar wind was most intense nearer the sun.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0082	so, it blew off lots of gas and dust from the terrestrial planets.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0083	The solar winds were not all that intense to cause similar removal of gases from the Jovian planets.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0084	The terrestrial planets are smaller and their lower gravity could not hold the escaping gases.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0085	The moon is the only natural satellite of the earth.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0086	Like the origin of the earth, there have been attempts to explain how the moon was formed.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0087	In 1838, Sir George Darwin suggested that initially, the earth and the moon formed a single rapidly rotating body
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0088	The whole mass became a dumb-bell-shaped body and eventually it broke
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0089	It was also suggested that the material forming the moon was separated from what we have at present the depression occupied by the Pacific Ocean
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0090	However, the present scientists do not accept either of the explanations.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0091	It is now generally believed that the formation of moon, as a satellite of the earth, is an outcome of ‘giant impact’ or what is described as “the big splat”.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0092	A body of the size of one to three times that of mars collided into the earth sometime shortly after the earth was formed
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0093	 This portion of blasted material then continued to orbit the earth
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0094	It blasted a large part of the earth into space.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0095	eventually formed into the present moon about 4.44 billion years ago.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0096	Do you know that the planet earth initially was a barren, rocky and hot object with a thin atmosphere of hydrogen and helium
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0097	This is far from the present day picture of the earth.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0098	Hence, there must have been some events–processes, which may have caused this change from rocky, barren and hot earth to a beautiful planet with ample amount of water and conducive atmosphere favouring the existence of life
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0099	In the following section, you will find out how the period, between the 4,600 million years and the present, led to the evolution of life on the surface of the planet
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0100	The earth has a layered structure.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0101	 From the outermost end of the atmosphere to the centre of the earth, the material that exists is not uniform
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0102	The present composition of earth’s atmosphere is chiefly contributed by nitrogen and oxygen
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0103	You will be dealing with the composition and structure of the earth’s atmosphere in Chapter 8
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0104	There are three stages in the evolution of the present atmosphere
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0105	The first stage is marked by the loss of primordial atmosphere
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0106	In the second stage, the hot interior of the earth contributed to the evolution of the atmosphere
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0107	Finally, the composition of the atmosphere was modified by the living world through the process of photosynthesis.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0108	The early atmosphere, with hydrogen and helium, is supposed to have been stripped off as a result of the solar winds
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0109	This happened not only in case of the earth, but also in all the terrestrial planets
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0110	During the cooling of the earth, gases and water vapour were released from the interior solid earth
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0111	This started the evolution of the present atmosphere.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0112	The early atmosphere largely contained water vapour, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia and very little of free oxygen
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0113	The process through which the gases were outpoured from the interior is called degassing
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0114	Continuous volcanic eruptions contributed water vapour and gases to the atmosphere
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0115	As the earth cooled, the water vapour released started getting condensed.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0116	The carbon dioxide in the atmosphere got dissolved in rainwater and the temperature further decreased
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0117	The rainwater falling onto the surface got collected in the depressions to give rise to oceans
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0118	The earth’s oceans were formed within 500 million years from the formation of the earth
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0119	This tells us that the oceans are as old as 4,000 million years.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0120	Sometime around 3,800 million years ago, life began to evolve
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0121	However, around 2,500-3,000 million years before the present, the process of photosynthesis got evolved
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0122	Life was confined to the oceans for a long time
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0123	Oceans began to have the contribution of oxygen through the process of photosynthesis.
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0124	Eventually, oceans were saturated with oxygen, and 2,000 million years ago, oxygen began to flood the atmosphere
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0125	The last phase in the evolution of the earth relates to the origin and evolution of life
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0126	It is undoubtedly clear that initially the earth or even the atmosphere of the earth was not conducive for the development of life
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0127	Modern scientists refer to the origin of life as a kind of chemical reaction, which first generated complex organic molecules and assembled them
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0128	This assemblage was such that they could duplicate themselves converting inanimate matter into living substance. 
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0129	The record of life that existed on this planet in different periods is found in rocks in the form of fossils
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0130	The microscopic structures closely related to the present form of blue algae have been found in geological formations much older than some 3,000 million years
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0131	 It can be assumed that life began to evolve sometime 3,800 million years ago
Geo_ncert_11stnd_2ch-bk1_0132	The summary of evolution of life from unicellular bacteria to the modern man is given in the Geological Time
